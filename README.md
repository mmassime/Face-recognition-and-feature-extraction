# Face-recognition-and-feature-extraction
This is a project made for the computer vision course HO205 at KU Leuven. In this project we use a small dataset of faces and build different face recognition models. We also use some algorithms to extract features and reduce the dimensionality of the pictures (SIFT and PCA) and analyze how they works and what are their effects.
